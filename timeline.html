                       understandable if you haven’t thought seriously about big day planning yet.
                        But now, fresh from engagement celebrations, is the best time to start.

            <h3 class="line71">A Complete Wedding Planning Checklist for Your Big Day</h3>
            <h4 class="line61">No two weddings are the same, and you may feel some wedding planning tasks 
                listed below do not represent your celebration. The actual wedding planning
                 timeline itself could also be entirely different to your own.

                We’ve used a 12-month engagement to create this plan, just to keep things simple.
                 However, the average is often more like 16–18 months. With this in mind, it’s
                  important you use our wedding planning checklist as a template. Adapting the timings,
                   events, and tasks to suit your own big day.
                
                Wedding planning doesn’t have to be stressful, in fact, thanks to our checklist,
                 we believe it’ll actually be fun!</h4>

        </h2>
        <p class="line61">While this is technically a pre-wedding-planning activity,
             it deserves special mention. We suggest purchasing insurance
              for that precious new bling as soon as you come down from that post-proposal
               high—unless your fiancé already took care of it before the big debut, of course.</p>
        <h3 class="line71">Work Out Your Budget</h3>
        <p class="line61">It's time to do the math and crunch some not-so-fun numbers. 
            Before you can start anything, you have to figure out who's paying for what
             and determine your wedding's bottom line. From there, you'll want to break 
             down said budget—what's a priority and what's not?—and start allocating funds accordingly.
              (A little market research here comes in handy.) And since these numbers will change as you plan,
               it's smart to start a detailed spreadsheet from the get-go. This will help you keep track of
                spending and make it easy to adjust numbers along the way.</p>
        <h3 class="line71">Start Creating a Guest List</h3>
        <p class="line61">The size of your venue and the size of your budget will dictate the number of people 
            you can invite to your wedding. Which is why it’s so crucial to follow a wedding planning checklist
             such as ours, and attempt to complete tasks in order.

            During the formulation of a wedding budget, couples typically start to get an idea of how much each
             guest will cost them. Especially when they start to discuss numbers with catering companies and venues.
              Use this information, and your budget, to help put together a maximum number of people you can invite.
            
            At this stage, your list of invitees should very much be at the draft stage. Just names on the page.
             Further down the line, you’ll start to filter and fine tune the guest list based on how wedding plans are
              progressing, both aesthetically, and financially!</p><br>
            <img src="https://planning.wedding/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic0.planning.wedding%2Fpages%2Flanding-checklist%2Fchecklist-wedding-guests.png&w=1920&q=85"
              width=100% height=800px>
              <h3 class="line71">Talk to Each Other About Priorities</h3>
              <p class="line61">Start your marriage in the right way, by discussing what you both want from your wedding.
                 Do you want it to be a large family affair? A celebration of the union between your families. Or would you
                  prefer the day was more about you? With just close friends and family invited. These two wedding styles are
                   both ends of the spectrum, and it’s likely you’ll know by now which of these camps your partner fits into.
                    But you should make sure.

                There are many critical aspects to a wedding that your partner may have strong feelings about. And it’s essential
                 you discuss these points before planning can really progress.
                
                You should both feel like you’re on the same page, putting together
                 a wedding that satisfies both of your desires. Ask each other what
                  is important to you about this celebration? For you, what should be
                   a priority? Write every thought and feeling down, and after enough
                    discussion, you should feel like the wedding is taking shape in front
                     of your very eyes!</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Choose a Wedding Venue</h3>
              <p class="line61">The wedding venue you select will impact every other planning decision you make. Unquestionably.

                It will likely be the biggest expenditure in your wedding budget. Therefore, it will dictate how much you can spend
                 on everything else.<br> Its location will determine which vendors you can hire. Its style will guide the theme of your big day,
                  sometimes quite dramatically. And its size will certainly impact how many guests you can invite.
                
                With all of this in mind, explore all the options you have in your local area, or chosen wedding destination. Visit as many
                 venues as you can, ask questions while you’re there, and try to remain critical when selecting between one space and another.<br>
                
                During this early period in the wedding planning timeline, it’s easy to get swept up in the emotion of it all, and start making
                 decisions with your heart, and not your head. Of course, your desire for the perfect venue, a place that matches your fantasy,
                  should be met. But not at the expense of the rest of your wedding plans. Lean on each other at this time, and try to keep each other in check.</p><br>

                width=100% height=800px>
                <h3 class="line71">Pick a Date</h3>
                <p class="line61">It’s good to have a range of dates in mind when contacting venues and pivotal vendors. Remaining flexible on when exactly you want to tie the knot.
                     The availability of your venue will likely be the deciding factor in your wedding date. But if there are VIPs in your family or circle of friends who you cannot
                      imagine getting hitched without, it’s best to consult them too before finalizing anything in the diary.</p><br>
                 <h2 class="timelinehead">11 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
                 <h3 class="line71">Book the Most In Demand Wedding Vendors</h3>
                  <p class="line61">Vendors such as photographers, videographers, musicians, and caterers play such a critical role in the feel of a wedding, that they get booked up many
                   months, if not years in advance.
                    Photographers in particular are responsible for capturing your memories. They are the only vendor whose value can be truly felt long after the big day.<br> Which is
                   why they are considered an ‘investment’, and are selected with much higher scrutiny than other services.
                  All the vendors mentioned above will be in high demand during peak wedding season, and the last thing you want is to miss out on the perfect person or team.
                   Decide on the priority suppliers for you, and book them early to avoid disappointment.</p>
                <h3 class="line71">Begin Putting Together Your Theme</h3>
                <p class="line61">Fun stuff, finally! And this is such a fun time because no major design decisions have to be made right now. You should just be feeling out what
                   works for you, and what suits the space you’re marrying in.<br>
                  Get lost on Pinterest, create some physical mood boards and get playful with color ideas. If you’re struggling for inspiration, or you’re feeling overwhelmed
                   with the number of influences online, talk to loved ones. They don’t even have to be married. Just pull together a bunch of friends, and family who you feel
                    will be creatively useful, and see what you all come up with. Worse comes to worst, you have a fun night together!</p><br>
                <h2 class="timelinehead">10 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
                <h3 class="line71">Wedding Dress Shopping</h3>
                <p class="line61">It may surprise you just how long wedding dresses take to order (6-8 months depending on the designer), and be ready to wear on the big day.
                   Not to mention the time, it can take to find ‘the one’.

                  Therefore, it’s good to allow yourself plenty of time for wedding dress shopping, to ensure it’s a pleasurable, non-rushed experience.</p>
                <h3 class="line71">Pick Your Wedding Party</h3>
                <p class="line61">You may have known for some time who will be in your wedding party, but your friends and family will be waiting anxiously
                   for confirmation! At this stage, if you’re still deliberating, there’s no need to make a final decision. But it’s good to think about it seriously,
                    before you get too far into the wedding timeline, and need to order suits, dresses etc for the group.</p><br>
            <img src="https://planning.wedding/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic0.planning.wedding%2Fpages%2Flanding-checklist%2Fchecklist-party.png&w=750&q=85"
            width="100%" height="800px">
            <h3 class="line71">Nail Down Your Guest List</h3>
            <p class="line61">Finalizing the guest list is a tough task for any couple. Cutting people from the list, picking one guest over another – it can all feel
               like a hard pill to swallow. But, it has to be done before you can start ordering stationery or 
              officially confirming numbers with vendors.</p><br>
              <h2 class="timelinehead">9 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
              <h3 class="line71">Send Out Save the Dates</h3>
              <p class="line61">The perfect companion to your wedding website is the save the date. That piece of card that falls on the mats of everyone invited to your 
                big day, and officially kicks off the adventure you and your guests are going to go on together!

                <br>By this time, you should have a fully formed theme and know what color scheme and style you’re going to be using. Hint at that on your save the dates,
                 and give guests a little insight into what to expect on the day.</p>
            <h3 class="line71">Select & Purchase Your Wedding Dress</h3>
            <p class="line61">To avoid extra stress, and any potential fees for rush deliveries, now is a good point on the wedding planning checklist to order your bridal dress.</p>
            <h3 class="line71">Book Other Priority Vendors</h3>
            <p class="line61">You should have already booked your photographer, catering and any other pivotal vendor for your big day. But there are many others who also play
               a significant role in the overall ambiance, and logistics of the celebration.<br>

              Are you marrying and dinning outside, for example? You’ll need to order a tent, heating, potentially extra power and rentals to help complete the alfresco experience.
               These types of rentals, especially the in-demand or more unique ones,
               will certainly get booked up during peak season. Get in quick and secure what you need.</p>
              <h2 class="timelinehead">8 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
               <h3 class="line71">Book the Florist</h3>
              <p class="line61">Florists are another vendor that tends to fill their diaries early, especially the good ones! Therefore,
                 it’s wise to request recommendations, thoughtfully browse social media for looks and find the right person as swiftly
                  as you can. After all, it cannot be overstated the effect flowers have on the overall feel of a wedding day. Therefore,
                   it pays to get the appropriate florist for you.</p><br>
                <img src="https://planning.wedding/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic0.planning.wedding%2Fpages%2Flanding-checklist%2Fchecklist-florist.png&w=750&q=85"
                width="100%" height="800px">
              <h3 class="line71">Create a Wedding Gift Registry</h3>
              <p class="line61">Couples usually fall into two camps when it comes to wedding gifts. Those who feel a bit weird about requesting gifts from loved ones,
                 and those who know exactly what they want! If you do feel uneasy about the prospect, remember that your guests will buy you gifts regardless of any registry.
                  So you might as well request items you actually want, and need.<br>

                Talk to each other, go over gift lists together, and decide as a couple what things would best set you up for the future. You may feel you have everything you
                 need, and actually some cash towards the honeymoon or your new home would be better appreciated. Charity is another option.<br>
                
                Whichever route you take with the gift registry, make it clear on your wedding website and invitations.</p><br>
              <h3 class="line71">Go Bridesmaids Shopping</h3>
              <p class="line61">It’s good to ensure your bridesmaids feel like they have some choice in the dresses they wear on your big day, but it’s also wise
                 to enter boutiques with a vision in place. An idea of preferred colors, fabrics, and styles.<br>

                Research bridesmaids dresses online, and when you actually visit a store, encourage your girls to experiment with their look. Forcing bridesmaids
                 to wear a dress they don’t like never works. They’ll feel miserable, and you’ll end up with a look that’s a lot less joyous than you dreamed of.
                
                Instead, set boundaries, and get your girls to pick styles within those parameters. That way they get to wear a dress they like, and you get 
                a coherent wedding day look.</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Hire Wedding Band/Music</h3>
              <p class="line61">If you’re dreaming of dancing the night away to a live band, or would like musicians to play during your ceremony and other events
                 during the day – now’s the time to book them!<br>

                Choosing an artist capable of performing in a style reflective of your big day vibe is not always straightforward. Therefore, give yourself time
                 to find the perfect band, musician, or artist. And avoid missing out on booking the ideal performer.</p><br>
                 <h2 class="timelinehead">7 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
                 <h3 class="line71">Book Wedding Day Transport</h3>
              <p class="line61">Even if your reception is taking place in the same place as your ceremony, there will likely be journeys that still need to be
                made during the day/evening, by yourselves and your guests. The cars or buses you choose should reflect the style of celebration you’re planning,
                 while also, obviously, be suitable for the number of guests you’re inviting. Which can be tricky to work out!

               Be sure to look at your guest list carefully, and track who and where movements will take place. Then try to book the right number of vehicles for each journey.<br>
                Remember, it’s much better to have one car with only one person in because you overbooked vehicles, than to frantically try to hire taxis on the day.
               
               Some specialty vehicles, such as limos and horse-drawn carriages etc, do get booked up well in advance and will sometimes only do one job a day. Which makes
                this a good time to tick off the hiring of all vehicles, just to be sure.
               
               </p>
              <h3 class="line71">Taste and Decide on the Menu</h3>
              <p class="line61">For us, this is the highlight of the wedding planning timeline! A checklist task that does involve a fair bit of pressure because you’re
                deciding the meal for potentially hundreds of people. But also involves eating lots of delicious food!<br>

               Whether you’ve gone down the external catering route, or something more in-house. It’s good to sign off on the menu, and the various dietary choices
                early, so you can plan accordingly. Especially if you want guests to select their dishes ahead of time. Doing this will speed up service on the day,
                 but will require you to get requests in well ahead of the wedding, either via your wedding website or RSVP.</p><br>
                 <h2 class="timelinehead">6 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
                 <h3 class="line71">Book Hair & Makeup</h3>
              <p class="line61">Having professional hair and makeup done on the morning of your wedding is a great way to prepare for the day. For both you and your bridesmaids.
                Plus, it’ll ensure everyone has a coherent look in your wedding photography.<br>Each hair stylist and makeup artist will have their own style, and approach.
                 Therefore, finding the right professional for your wedding will take some research. Be sure to look through as many real bride pictures as possible, and 
                 pay close attention to reviews, as these will illustrate just how that vendor works on the day. An important aspect when you consider the typical wedding
                  morning is often a joyous, yet stressful time. Therefore, you need to find a professional who will orchestrate a calm environment.</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Book the Dream Honeymoon</h3>
              <p class="line61">During this, rather hectic part of the wedding planning checklist, booking an incredible honeymoon adventure can offer quite a cathartic
                experience. Whether you’re planning a dreamy getaway to the Maldives, or something more low-key closer to home. It’s nice to know you’re both working towards
                 a blissful break.

               Honeymoons offer the ideal way to tick off bucket-list destinations, and live the life of luxury for a short while. Which is why it’s key to plan yours well
                in advance to ensure every aspect of your trip is covered, and limit the chance of regrets.</p><br>
                <h2 class="timelinehead">4 MONTHS UNTIL THE WEDDING</h2>
                <h3 class="line71">Organize Outfit Accessories</h3>
              <p class="line61">By this point, both of your outfits should be picked and being prepared on your behalf. But to complete said outfit you’ll need
                certain accessories. Items like shoes, veil, certain hair accessories and underwear are all actually key to successful wedding dress alterations.
                 Which is why it’s a good idea to purchase them before you start fittings.<br>

               Shoe height will alter the length of your gown, and different types of undergarments can actually change the fit of your gown.
               
               For those wearing suits, it’s also a good idea to purchase accessories in advance, as cuff links, shoes, and even belts can also affect fit.</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Decide on the Finishing Touches</h3>
              <p class="line61">You’ve probably been picking up decor pieces throughout the wedding planning timeline, and by now have amassed quite a collection 
               of things. Now’s the time to tick off any other smaller items you haven’t purchased, organized rental of, or DIY’d yet.

               If you are choosing to make wedding details by hand, don’t leave their creation to the last minute. You’ll only add 
               extra stress onto your shoulders, and the end result may not look as spectacular as you envisioned.
               
               Many small decor items are actually quite pivotal to the guest experience. Things like place cards, signs, order of service, favors, 
               and guest book will all be greatly missed if not present, or put together without thought.</p><br>

               <h3 class="line71">Decide on the Wedding Day Schedule</h3>
              <p class="line61">Many of your vendors will need to know exactly-ish when they’re going to be required on the big day.
                Therefore, it’s wise not to leave the planning of your wedding day timeline to the last minute. Besides, it’s fun to imagine 
                just what you’ll be up to on the big day!

               Once you’ve got a set schedule in place, send it to your vendors. However,
                if you feel like big day elements will develop over the next 2–3 months, maybe hold off sending anything out unless strictly
                 necessary. Instead, create a draft and update it as you go. It’s best to avoid sending out multiple evolutions of your wedding
                  timetable. You’ll only increase the risk of confusion.</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Choose a Wedding Cake</h3>
              <p class="line61">Before this point in the wedding checklist, it’s a good idea to have already made contact, and potentially 
               booked a wedding cake maker. As during peak wedding season, many of the most popular vendors will have filled their diaries already.

               When choosing your wedding cake, go for a flavor profile you both like. It can be tempting to try to please guests with your choice
                – but you never will! For every one guest who adores the red velvet sponge creation you selected, they’ll be another two or three 
                who are unimpressed. Instead, choose something that suits the celebration and you think is delicious!</p>
              <h3 class="line71">Organize a Hair & Makeup Trial</h3>
              <p class="line61">If you intend to have an engagement shoot, arrange to have your hair and makeup trial on the same day.
                That way you’ll have a professionally put together look for your photos, and you’ll be able to test out what’ll work best on the big day.

               Don’t go in cold to your hair and makeup trial. Put some time aside on your checklist to research wedding looks and styles you want your
                artist to be inspired by. You may end up not having exactly the same look, but it’ll at least give your vendor a good idea of the vibe you desire.</p><br>

               <p class="line61">Now that your wedding invitations are in, and checked, it’s time to send them out to all of your excited guests! If you have guests
                   coming from overseas, be sure to allow more time for their invitations. And maybe even give them each a call before popping them in the post, just
                    to allow each of them to make their travel arrangements without feeling pressured.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="line71">Arrange Marriage License</h3>
               <p class="line61">Depending on where you’re tying the knot, the laws, and timings for getting a marriage license will differ. With this in mind, don’t 
                  leave this planning task to the last minute. Research early what needs to be done, and whether you need certain individuals, such as guests and/or 
                  an officiant present when obtaining the paperwork.</p><br>

                  <h3 class="line71">Write Your Vows</h3>
               <p class="line61">If you’re going down the non-religious route, crafting your own vows offers such a lovely way to make a ceremony feel unique,
                   and personal. Considering how ‘momentous the moment’ is, don’t leave writing your vows to the last minute. Get ahead of the game, and tick this task
                    off your wedding planning list while your mind is fizzing with excitement, and not pre-wedding nerves.</p>
               <h3 class="line71">Have Your Final Wedding Dress Fitting</h3>
               <p class="line61">Every wedding dress fitting schedule will be different, and yours may well be rapped up by now. For most brides, their dress is 
                  typically completed and ready for the big day around a month before. Which is perfect, as it leaves one-less thing to worry about!</p>
               <h3 class="line71">Pay Wedding Vendors</h3>
               <p class="line61">Some wedding vendors you’ll need to pay on the big day, whereas others can be paid in full beforehand. Try to get all the 
                  payments you can make in advance out of the way as soon as possible, to avoid any awkward conversations about money on your wedding day.<br>

                  When it comes to the vendors who’ll need to be paid during the celebrations, avoid paying them yourselves. Doing so will take you out
                   of the flow of the day, and stop you from truly relaxing. Instead, prepare cash envelopes for each vendor, with the exact amount inside,
                    plus tip. And assign the most trusted member of your wedding party the job of handing out the money. Let your vendors know who’ll be paying 
                    them too, just so they know who to look for when the time is right.</p><br>

               <h3 class="line71">Break in Wedding Shoes</h3>
               <p class="line61">We’ve all bought shoes thinking they’re the perfect fit, only to find after walking two blocks 
                  they’re causing massive blisters. Avoid this on your big day and wear wedding shoes around the house in the week leading up to the rehearsal dinner.</p>
               <h3 class="line71">Have Last-Minute Beauty Treatments</h3>
               <p class="line61">There will be some beauty and grooming treatments you shouldn’t leave to the week 
                  of your wedding. Just in case you get an allergic reaction. Waxing, Botox, skin peels and spray tans, for example, all need to be
                   done in advance. To avoid adverse effects, or not having any effect at all!<br>

                  Manicures, haircuts, and non-aggressive skin treatments can all be done in the week before your wedding.</p>
